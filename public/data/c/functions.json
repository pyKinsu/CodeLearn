      "question": "What is a function in C?",
      "options": [
        "A variable that stores data",
        "A block of code that performs a specific task",
        "A header file",
        "A keyword"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A function is a block of code designed to perform a specific task and can be reused multiple times."

      "question": "Which part of a function tells the compiler about the function name, return type, and parameters?",
      "options": [
        "Function call",
        "Function definition",
        "Function declaration",
        "Header file"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Function declaration informs the compiler about the function’s name, return type, and parameters."

      "id": 3,
      "question": "Which of the following correctly declares a function that returns an integer?",
      "options": [
        "function add(int a, int b);",
        "int add(int a, int b);",
        "add(int a, int b);",
        "integer add(int a, int b);"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "In C, a function declaration must specify the return type followed by the function name and parameters."
    },

      "id": 4,
      "question": "Where is the actual code of a function written?",
      "options": [
        "Function declaration",
        "Function prototype",
        "Function definition",
        "Function call"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The function definition contains the actual body (code) of the function."
    },

      "id": 5,
      "question": "What is a function call?",
      "options": [
        "Writing the function body",
        "Declaring a function",
        "Invoking a function to execute its code",
        "Including a header file"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "A function call is used to invoke a function and execute the statements defined inside it."

        "exit",
        "return",
        "continue"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The return keyword sends a value back to the calling function and ends function execution."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "What will happen if a function does not return any value?",
      "options": [
        "Program will crash",
        "Compiler error always occurs",
        "It should be declared with void return type",
        "It must return 0"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Functions that do not return a value should be declared with the void return type."
    },

      "id": 8,
      "question": "What is recursion?",
      "options": [
        "Calling one function from another",
        "Calling a function repeatedly using loops",
        "A function calling itself",
        "A function without parameters"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Recursion is a process where a function calls itself to solve a problem in smaller parts."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "Which condition is necessary to stop a recursive function?",
      "options": [
        "Loop condition",
        "Break statement",
        "Base condition",
        "Return type"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "A base condition is required in recursion to stop further recursive calls and prevent infinite recursion."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "What happens if a recursive function has no base condition?",
      "options": [
        "Program executes normally",
        "Function executes only once",
        "Infinite recursion occurs",
        "Compiler automatically stops it"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Without a base condition, a recursive function will keep calling itself, leading to infinite recursion and stack overflow."
